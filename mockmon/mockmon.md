# MOCKMON

A small project that I can be motivated to work on. A simple version of a battling game. The user (player) will control mock-monsters (mockmons) and battle the computer in a manner similar to the famoues game. 

## Tasks and Stages

- [ ] Basic program structure
- [x] Player choice modules - allow the user to choose an action
- [x] Create the minimal mockmon class (entity)
- [x] The most simple battle possible - the user has a mockmon and needs to choose the correct option to win
- [x] Design minimal enntities for moves (attacks) and mockmon stats
- [ ] ... TBC

### Mockmon battle mock

- [x] a battle with a win / lose conditions
- [x] user can choose actions vs opponent
- [ ] moves that do something and moves that fail
- [x] opponent can do something against user
- [ ] moves effect mockmon stats rather than directly the outcome
- [ ] mockmon stats effect the battle outcome
- [ ] moves can hit or miss
- [ ] moves can cause status effect
- [ ] moves are effected by stats (accuracy, power)
- [ ] status effects (poison, sleep, confision, etc...)
- [x] the type system! super, normal and not very effective!
- [ ] ... TBC battles are between trainers

### What's a mockmon, actually?

- [ ] basic mockmon class
- [x] stats
- [x] type(s)
- [x] moveset
- [ ] status
- [x] progression (exp)
- [ ] uniqeness (iv, ev, unique id)
- [ ] mockmon evolution

### This is supposed to be a game

- [ ] start game, end game condition
- [ ] display options to user
- [ ] user control over outcome - get user choice
- [ ] meanning full progression path
- [ ] more than one progerssion path
- [ ] none linear progression path
- [ ] can data be saved and loaded?

### Controller stuff
- [ ] dpad, action, cancel, start select
