# FlexingMyCode
general repository for all sorts of code that I want to share with the world.

## Knights_tour
C style implementation of the knights tour problem - how can a knight piece travel a chess board without repeating the same square.
Originally written in C using a self made bit array. adapted to use std::bitset<64>.

## Reverse_sentece
C implementation of reversing the words in a sentence.

## Product_without
C solution to finding the product all element in an array except one, without using the division operator.

## Calculator
C style implemantion of a calculator. Takes a string with a math equation (supports addution, substraction, multiplication, division, power and brackets) and computes the result.
originally used a self made stack, adapted to use std::stack<double> instead, also orignally complied with a very strict C standard. I decided to keep the code as it was to preserve the originial structure, including all the oddeties.

## Five_Stars
A program the prints 5 rows, the first row has one star, and the last has five stars. Inspired by a facebook meme. I decided to use the most complicated way to get the same output, so I went with templates. *obviously this is not a good idea*.

## Roman_Numerals
A class that represents roman numerals ("ivxlcdm"), an oppertuinity to play with strings.

## Mockmon
My attempt to recreate the battle engine of the famous rpg game.
