# FlexingMyCode
general repository for all sorts of code that I want to share with the world.

## Knights_tour
C style implementation of the knights tour problem - how can a knight piece travel a chess board without repeating the same square.
Originally written in C using a self made bit array. adapted to use std::bitset<64>.

## Reverse_sentece
C implementation of reversing the words in a sentence.

## Product_without
C solution to finding the product all element in an array except one, without using the division operator.

## Calculator
C style implemantion of a calculator. Takes a string with a math equation (supports addution, substraction, multiplication, division, power and brackets) and computes the result.
originally used a self made stack, adapted to use std::stack<double> instead, also orignally complied with a very strict C standard. I decided to keep the code as it was to presere, including all the oddeties.
